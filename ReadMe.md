# Introduction to Programming with Rust

This repository contains (actually, it will have) the slides of a new course on "Introduction to Programming with Rust". I teach this course in the second semester at Technische Universit√§t Dresden, Germany. Each year a few hundred students take this course. Most of the students have learned about algorithms in high school. They learned some programming with Python, Lazarus, or Go.

In the following year (i.e., 2024), this lecture will move from the 2nd to the first semester. There might be some changes to adjust for this. 

## Sharing

I share the pdf of the slides in this repository. I created these with Keynote. If you want to use these in one of your courses, please email me.
